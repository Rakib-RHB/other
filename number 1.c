explain:

This C program reads two integers, n and m, from the user. It then reads a sequence of m strings and updates the value of cnt based on the first character of each string. Finally, it prints the updated value of cnt. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

#include <stdio.h> and #include <string.h> are standard C library headers that provide functions for input and output and string manipulation, respectively.

The main function is the entry point of the program.

Two integer variables n and m are declared to store the initial values provided by the user, and a character array temp of size 10 is declared to temporarily store each string.

scanf("%d %d", &n, &m); reads two integers from the user and stores them in the variables n and m.

An integer variable cnt is initialized with the value of n. This variable will be updated as we process the input strings.

The program enters a while loop that runs m times, where m represents the number of strings the program should read and process.

Inside the loop, scanf("%s", temp); reads a string from the user and stores it in the temp array.

The code then checks the first character of the string using temp[0]. There are two possible cases:

If the first character of the string is 'f', it means the user wants to increment the cnt variable, so cnt is increased by 1.

If the first character of the string is not 'f', it means the user wants to decrement the cnt variable, so cnt is decreased by 1.

After processing all the strings, the program prints the final value of cnt using printf("%d\n", cnt);.

In summary, this program takes two integers as input and then processes a sequence of strings, updating a counter (cnt) based on the first character of each string. The final value of cnt is printed as the output.
